I started this as part of an "above and beyond" project for an interview process that I really had no interest in back 2016, because I was curious about the company.  The 2 people that I dealt with there were just douchey, for example I sat in the lobby for 15 minutes after when the intervew was supposed to start, keep in mind that this was suppose to be a 1 hour interview, 25 percent of the time allotted was wasted due to their disorganization.  There were other creepy stuff too.  Those dochey people are still trolling my repos.

Just for funsie as a mental-break, whenever I have free time, I'm converting this from jQuery to pure JavaScript.
