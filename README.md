# javascript-memory-game
The title says it all dawg.
This app is deployed here: http://www.uproariouslaughter.com/js-memory-game
This whole thing is a pretty ui around the Fisher Yates Modern Shuffle algorithm, which has been around for a really long time.

I've intentionally not used a transpiler for this app because I refused to placate Internet Exploder.
